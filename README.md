# EDA-Heart-Disease
# Heart Disease Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing
# 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing on the Heart Disease dataset.
The goal is to clean, visualize, and prepare the data for future machine learning tasks like heart disease prediction.

# 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
Data Cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates)
Exploratory Data Analysis (correlation analysis, visualizations)
Feature Engineering (creating new features, encoding)
Scaling and Normalization
Data Preparation for Machine Learning

# 📂 Dataset
Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
Features: Age, Gender, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, etc.
Target: Presence or absence of heart disease

# 📊 EDA Highlights
Distribution of age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure
Gender differences in heart disease risk
Correlation heatmap of features
Visualizations of key risk factors

# 🧹 Data Preprocessing Steps
Handling missing data
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling
Outlier detection and handling

# 📈 Future Scope
Building a classification model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
Hyperparameter tuning
Deployment as an API
